# Data-Cleaning-and-Analysis
My own cleaning data process to show

Here you can find some projects that I like to create in order to practice and master SQL

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Project: [SQL data exploration of COVID-19 dataset](https://github.com/Aff1nity/Data-Cleaning-and-Analysis/tree/main/Covid%20SQL%20Project)

The portfolio contains SQL queries used to analyze data from the CovidDeaths and CovidVaccinations tables in the PortfolioProject database.
I have added extensive comments inside the SQL file so as to explain in detailed my thought process. I do this in order to help my learning process.
